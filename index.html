                  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                  were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                  honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                  I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                  people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
                  free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                  shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                  grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
                  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer

                They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
                during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
                certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
